# Building Dataverse plugins using Power Platform CLI (pac)


## Create Solution containuing Plugins

### Initialize solution
```
> pac solution init ---publisher-name soulsoftware --publisher-prefix soul
> dotnet build
```

### Import solution to environment

localize the zip in `bin\Debug` and use it in the follow command 

```
> pac solution import --path <solution's zip path> --async
```

## Create a Plugin invoked over a step


### Create plugin project

make a directory `plugin-src/<Plugin Folder>` and move in after that, run commands:
```
> pac plugin init
> dotnet build
``` 

### Plugin registration (Once only on Windows ðŸ¥²)

Plugin registration has done throught a [Plugin Registration Tool](PRT) available only on Windows platform ðŸ¥².

The easy way to install and run [Plugin Registration Tool](PRT) is :
```
> pac tool prt
```

Using  [Plugin Registration Tool](PRT) we can register into dataverse either the assembly and the dataverse action associated (step) with it

### Add plugin reference into solution

Make sure that the `<Solution>.cdsproj` has a reference to the `<plugin assembly>.cdsproj` to ensure that Dll get built when the solution is built, then go to in solution folder and run:
```
> pac add-reference --path <plugin's project folder>
```

### Push plugin update 

After any plugin's code modification you can push the update run command

```
pac plugin push --pluginFile <path of dll> --pluginId <assemblyId>
```

You can find the `assemblyId` within file at `<solution folder>/src/PluginAssemblies/<plugin name>-<assemblyId>/<plugin name>.dll.data.xml`

## TIP: PAC CLI ModelBuilder 

### early-bound classes

Use of **early-bound classes** in customization projects that targets Dataverse tables and actions increase code readability and maintainability, they also significantly reduce the risk of errors. 

Recently, the Microsoft Power Platform CLI (PAC CLI) introduced the new `modelbuilder`` command group that **enables early bound classes** generation directly from the CLI. 

```
pac modelbuilder build --entitynamesfilter <entity name> -o <outputdir>  --writesettingsTemplateFile
```
